# blaya
A collection of scripts which enable UI features similar to Maya in Blender 2.8+

# Maya-Pie Menus for modelling:
![Pie-Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50917034/91654394-8ed5c100-eaa8-11ea-9ab6-93842552ad7a.gif)

## How to intall:
Ideally, place the two .py files in your Blender startup script folder. For example (Linux):
```
mv maya_pie_ctrl.py /usr/share/blender/scripts/startup/
mv maya_pie_shift.py /usr/share/blender/scripts/startup/
```

## How to use
Maya users should be familiar with how these pie-menus are used. I suggest you use them together with the "Industry Standard" key map in Blender.

* Ctrl + Right Click 
* Shift + Right Click

The options that are shown are dependent on the mode you are currently in, edit mode or object mode. Further, they are sensitive to the selection mode in edit mode (vertex, edge or face).

For now, only the options I use most often are present. Feel free to suggest something you are missing.
